# Optional: use a client certificate instead of (or in addition to) CLIENT_SECRET.
# When configured, the app will prefer the certificate over the secret.
# Path to a PEM-encoded private key/certificate file on disk, for example
# using the local certs/ folder described in the README:
# ENTRA_CLIENT_CERT_PATH="/absolute/path/to/your/repo/certs/entra-app-private.key"

# Thumbprint of the certificate as configured in Entra ID:
# ENTRA_CLIENT_CERT_THUMBPRINT="<Your-Certificate-Thumbprint>"

# Optional password if the private key is encrypted:
# ENTRA_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD="<Your-Certificate-Password>"

# The base authority URL. The full authority URL is constructed in config.py
# Example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/
AUTHORITY_BASE_URL="https://login.microsoftonline.com/"

# When true, expose raw ID token claims to the profile page for debugging.
